# Enhancing Packet Loss Concealment with Generative Spectrogram Inpainting

This repository contains all the project files to replicate the experiments described in the technical reports provided.

To start train the _bin2bin_ network from scratch, set the appropriate dataset path variable(s) in `train_config.yaml`, then run `train_b2b_lpc.py` while passing the chosen dataset name as an argument. 

Pretrained Generator checkpoints for both _lite_ and _full_ bin2bin versions are available [here](https://mega.nz/folder/7MJ2TC5C#Bf0ewaRbRy5ouX5pN9KrpA);
